# Sustainable-Carbon-Dioxide-Capture-and-Utilization-System-SCDCUS-
SCDCUS is a sustainable concept  which biomimetically replicate ecosystem services like climate control through a specifically  developed system that captures atmospheric carbon.
 This theoretical system integrates advanced 
nanostructures for light harvesting, synthetic chloroplast-like entities for CO₂ fixation, innovative 
biomimetic membranes for selective gas separation, artificial stomata and synthetic 
photosynthesis. It provides a very effective method towards using atmospheric CO₂ for the 
production of value added products such as plastics, fuels, and building materials, within a 
circular carbon economy framework by working in tandem with nature's processes for carbon 
sequestration and mineralization and therefore may be considered as a answer for global 
warming.
